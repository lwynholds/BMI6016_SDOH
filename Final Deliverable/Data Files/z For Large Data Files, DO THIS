Several data files are too big to store in GitHub. They are hosted on Box. 
Go to https://uofu.box.com/v/LWYNHOLDS-BMI6016-SDOH-LG-DF and download all these files to the Data Files folder, so they are stored with the smaller data files. 
This includes "one_df_to_rule_them_all.csv", which happens to be auto-generated by running the Group 4 Jupyter notebook from the beginning ... but we are including it here in its generated form as a courtesy. (People grading our work should use the version of this csv generated by the code.)
P.S. You won't want to attempt to open the "one_df" with Excel, it's too big and will shed data. Just analyze it, unopened, with Python.
